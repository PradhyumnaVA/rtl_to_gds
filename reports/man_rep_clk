ARGUMENTS
       -type report_type
              Specifies  the  type  of report to be generated.  Allowed values
              are as follows:

               o transition - specifies a transition time report.

               o latency - specifies a latency report.

               o skew - specifies a skew report.  You cannot use the  -launch,
                -capture,  -rise,  -fall, -min, -max, and -lesser_than options
                if you specify a skew report.  You can use the -include_uncer-
                tainty_in_skew option only in a skew, interclock_skew, or sum-
                mary report.

               o interclock_skew - specifies an interclock skew  report.   You
                cannot  use  the  -launch, -capture, -rise, -fall, -min, -max,
                and -lesser_than options if you  specify  an  interclock  skew
                report.   You  can use the -include_uncertainty_in_skew option
                only in a skew, interclock_skew, or summary report.

               o summary - specifies a summary report  that  shows  the  worst
                instances of transition time, latency, and skew over the clock
                networks or subnetworks of interest.  You  can  use  only  the
                -clock,  -to_list,  -from_list,  -include_uncertainty_in_skew,
                -nosplit, and -significant_digits options  if  you  specify  a
                summary report.

              For non-summary reports, report entries are ordered with respect
              to  the  specified  attribute  of  interest  (transition   time,
              latency,  or  skew).  All skews reported are "local" skews.  For
              an explanation of local skew, see the DESCRIPTION section.

       -clock clock_list
              Specifies a list of clock networks to be used in the report.   A
              subreport  is produced for every clock in clock_list, unless you
              additionally specify a to_list or a from_list that has  no  net-
              work  intersection  with  a given clock.  In that case, the tool
              drops these clocks from the clock_list and issues a warning.  By
              default,  if  you  do  not specify clock_list, all clocks in the
              design that have associated  clock  networks  are  used  in  the
              report.

       -from_clock from_clock_list
              Specifies  a list of clock networks to be used as from-clocks in
              the current interclock skew report.  This  option  can  be  used
              only  in  an interclock skew report.  The report considers every
              clock in the from_clock_list, unless you additionally specify  a
              from_list  that  has no network intersection with a given clock.
              In  that  case,  the  tool   drops   these   clocks   from   the
              from_clock_list and issues a warning.  By default, if you do not
              specify a from_clock_list, all clocks in the  design  that  have
              associated clock networks are used as from-clocks in the report.

       -to_clock to_clock_list
              Specifies  a  list  of clock networks to be used as to-clocks in
              the current interclock skew report.  This  option  can  be  used
              only  in  an interclock skew report.  The report considers every
              clock in the to_clock_list, unless you  additionally  specify  a
              to_list that has no network intersection with a given clock.  In
              that case, the tool drops these clocks  from  the  to_clock_list
              and  issues  a  warning.   By  default,  if you do not specify a
              to_clock_list, all clocks in the  design  that  have  associated
              clock networks are used as to-clocks in the report.

       -to to_list
              Specifies  the list of sequential clock network pins or ports to
              consider as to-pins in the current report.  If any named pin  is
              not  the  clock pin of a sequential device (such as a sink pin),
              the tool replaces that pin with all sequential clock pins in the
              transitive  fanout of the named pin.  If there are no sequential
              clock pins in the pin's transitive fanout, the  pin  is  dropped
              from the list with a warning message.

              For  skew reports, the from-to skew sense is defined by the pins
              in the from_list and the to_list, respectively.  If the  to_list
              is  not  specified,  by default all sink pins in the given clock
              networks are used.  Thus, specifying to_list reduces  the  topo-
              logical  scope  of  the report.  For transition time and latency
              reports, from_list and to_list are concatenated and treated as a
              single  list.   if neither list is specified, to_list is assumed
              to be populated with all sink pins in the given clock networks.

       -from from_list
              Specifies a list of sequential clock network pins  or  ports  to
              consider  as from-pins in the current report.  If a named pin is
              not the clock pin of a sequential device, the tool replaces that
              pin  with  all sequential clock pins in the transitive fanout of
              the named pin.  If there are no sequential  clock  pins  in  the
              pin's transitive fanout, the pin is dropped from the list with a
              warning message.

              For skew reports, the from-to skew sense is defined by the  pins
              in   the  from_list  and  the  to_list,  respectively.   If  the
              from_list is not specified, by default  all  sink  pins  in  the
              given clock networks are used.  Specifying the from_list reduces
              the topological scope of the report.  For  transition  time  and
              latency  reports, the from_list and to_list are concatenated and
              treated  as  a  single  list.   If  neither  is  specified,  the
              from_list  is  assumed to be populated with all sink pins in the
              given clock networks.

       -setup Specifies that only the setup data path is to  be  used  in  the
              report,  and  that  the  skews,  latencies,  or transition times
              reported must correspond to those used by the report_timing com-
              mand  in  the verification of setup constraints.  The -setup and
              -hold options are mutually  exclusive.   If  neither  option  is
              specified,  -setup  is  assumed.   This option cannot be used in
              summary reports.

       -launch
              Specifies that only pins launching data are to be  used  in  the
              report,  and  that  latencies  or transition times reported must
              correspond to  those  used  by  the  report_timing  command  for
              sequential  device  clock pins that are launching data.  In skew
              reports, the role is implicit from the from-to  sense  indicated
              by  the  from_list  and  the to_list.  In all other reports, the
              -launch and -capture options are mutually exclusive.  If neither
              option  is specified, -launch is assumed.  This option cannot be
              used in summary or skew reports.

       -rise  Specifies that the  active  transition  is  a  rising  edge  for
              sequential  device  clock pins in the current report.  The -rise
              and -fall options are mutually exclusive.  If neither option  is
              specified,  the  active  transition  at  a latch or flip-flop is
              deduced from the launch or capture role and the behavior of  the
              sequential  device  itself.   This  option enables you to answer
              "what if" questions regarding latency  and  transition  time  at
              sequential  device  clock  pins.   This option cannot be used in
              summary or skew reports.

       -min   Specifies that the reports are to be sorted by minimum latencies
              or  transition  times.   The  -min and -max options are mutually
              exclusive.  If neither option  is  specified,  the  reports  are
              sorted  in  the same manner as described for the -nworst option.
              This option cannot be used in summary or skew reports.  To check
              the  quality  of a balanced clock tree network, you can generate
              two latency reports, one with -min and one with -max.

       -nworst worst_entries
              Specifies the number of worst report entries to be reported  per
              clock  domain.  The default value is 1.  Entries are sorted with
              respect to the attribute of interest (transition time,  latency,
              or skew) specified with -type report_type.

              The  worst  entries  are those most likely to cause a violation.
              For example, if you request a latency report  using  -setup  and
              -capture,  the  smallest  worst_entries  are  listed,  sorted in
              ascending order, because small capture latencies for setup paths
              are more likely to lead to a violation than large capture laten-
              cies.  For skew reports, the worst entries always correspond  to
              the  largest skews over the specified domain.  The above defini-
              tion of "worst" can be overridden by use of  the  -min  or  -max
              options.  This option cannot be used in summary reports.

       -greater_than lower_limit
              Specifies   that   only  those  entries  whose  attribute  value
              (latency, transition time, or skew) is greater  (more  positive)
              than  lower_limit are shown.  This option cannot be used in sum-
              mary reports.

       -lesser_than upper_limit
              Specifies  that  only  those  entries  whose   attribute   value
              (latency, transition time, or skew) is less (more negative) than
              upper_limit are shown.  This option cannot be used in summary or
              skew reports.

       -slack_lesser_than slack_upper_limit
              Specifies  that  only  those  entries  whose slack value is less
              (more negative) than  slack_upper_limit  are  shown.   For  skew
              report entries, slack is the worst slack over all paths launched
              by the from-pin and captured by the to-pin.  For transition time
              or  latency  report entries, slack is defined as the worst slack
              of all paths either launched by a transition at the sink pin (if
              -launch is used) or captured by a transition at the sink pin (if
              -capture is used).

              Using this filter can  greatly  increase  the  runtime  of  this
              report.  However, when used with -capture, the effect on runtime
              should be small, since the tool is able to make  use  of  cached
              slack values to avoid expensive recomputation.  This option can-
              not be used in summary reports.

       -include_uncertainty_in_skew
              Specifies that the user-defined uncertainty between the  sequen-
              tial devices in a launch/capture pair is to be considered a com-
              ponent of skew.  This option can be used only in skew  and  sum-
              mary reports.

       -verbose
              Specifies  that  a  more  detailed  report  is  to be generated.
              Instead of a single line per  pin,  verbose  reports  trace  the
              entire  source-to-sink  path through a clock network to show how
              the final reported attribute (skew, latency, or transition time)
              was accumulated over the course of the path.  This option cannot
              be used in summary reports.

       -show_clocks
              Specifies that the launching and  capturing  clocks  are  to  be
              shown  for  every  interclock skew entry in the report.  This is
              useful if the from_clock_list or the to_clock_list contains more
              than one clock each.  This option can only be used in interclock
              skew reports.

       -nosplit
              Prevents line splitting  and  facilitates  writing  software  to
              extract information from the report output.  By default, most of
              the design information is listed in fixed-width columns.  If the
              information  in a given field exceeds the column width, the next
              field begins on a new line, starting in the correct column.

       -significant_digits digits
              Specifies the number of digits after the  decimal  point  to  be
              displayed for time values in the generated report.  Allowed val-
              ues  are  0-13.   The  default  value  is  determined   by   the
              report_default_significant_digits  variable, whose default value
              is 2.  Use this option if you  want  to  override  the  default.
              This  option  controls  only the number of digits displayed, not
              the precision used internally for analysis.  For  analysis,  the
              tool  uses the full precision of the platform's fixed-precision,
              floating-point arithmetic capability.

       -nets  Shows nets in verbose path traces.  The default is not  to  show
              nets.   To  show  the  delay  for  the nets, use the -input_pins
              option.  This option  is  similar  to  its  counterpart  in  the
              report_timing command.

       -capacitance
              Shows  the  total  (lumped)  capacitance in verbose path traces.
              The default is not to show capacitance.  For  each  driver  pin,
              the  total  capacitance  driven  by the driver is displayed in a
              column preceding both  incremental  path  delay  and  transition
              time.   When  -nets  is specified, the capacitance is printed on
              the lines with nets instead of the lines with driver pins.  This
              option  is  similar to its counterpart in the report_timing com-
              mand.

       -attributes
              Shows in verbose path traces the  attributes  specified  in  the
              timing_report_attributes   variable.    The   current   set   of
              attributes supported are  dont_touch,  dont_use,  map_only,  and
              size_only  for  cells,  and  dont_touch  and ideal_net for nets.
              This option is similar to its counterpart in  the  report_timing
              command.

       -physical
              Shows the locations of the pins and the capacitive loads for the
              pins and nets in verbose path traces.  The loads  are  displayed
              as  a  pair of values of which the first is the wire capacitance
              of the net and the second value is the total capacitance  driven
              by  the  driver.   If the pin location cannot be determined, the
              cell location is displayed, with  the  coordinates  in  microns.
              This  option  is similar to its counterpart in the report_timing
              command.

       -filter_false_paths
              Causes the command to eliminate false paths  from  consideration
              during calculation of local register-to-register skew, resulting
              in more accurate (less  pessimistic)  reporting  of  skew.   The
              default behavior is to not eliminate false paths from considera-
              tion.

       -variation
              Reports the mean and standard deviation of the statistical  time
              increment  for  each  source-to-sink  path element in a -verbose
              report.  This option works only when parametric  on-chip  varia-
              tion  (POCV)  analysis  has  been  enabled  by  setting the tim-
              ing_pocvm_enable_analysis variable to true.  By default, statis-
              tical parameters are not reported.

       -scenarios scenario_list
              Reports  clock timing for a specified set of scenarios and skips
              reporting of inactive scenarios.

       -max   Specifies that the reports are to be sorted by maximum latencies
              or  transition  times.   The  -min and -max options are mutually
              exclusive.  If neither option  is  specified,  the  reports  are
              sorted  in  the same manner as described for the -nworst option.
              This option cannot be used in summary or skew reports.  To check
              the  quality  of a balanced clock tree network, you can generate
              two latency reports, one with -min and one with -max.

       -fall  Specifies that the active  transition  is  a  falling  edge  for
              sequential  device  clock pins in the current report.  The -rise
              and -fall options are mutually exclusive.  If neither option  is
              specified,  the  active  transition  at  a latch or flip-flop is
              deduced from the launch or capture role and the behavior of  the
              sequential  device  itself.   This  option enables you to answer
              "what if" questions regarding latency  and  transition  time  at
              sequential  device  clock  pins.   This option cannot be used in
              summary or skew reports.

       -capture
              Specifies that only pins capturing data are to be  used  in  the
              report, and that the latencies or transition times reported must
              correspond to  those  used  by  the  report_timing  command  for
              sequential  device  clock pins that are capturing data.  In skew
              reports, the role is implicit from the from-to  sense  indicated
              by  the  from_list  and  the to_list.  In all other reports, the
              -launch and -capture options are mutually exclusive.  If neither
              option  is specified, -launch is assumed.  This option cannot be
              used in summary or skew reports.

       -hold  Specifies that only the hold data path is  to  be  used  in  the
              report,  and  that  the  skews,  latencies,  or transition times
              reported must correspond to those used by the report_timing com-
              mand  in  the  verification of hold constraints.  The -setup and
              -hold options are mutually  exclusive.   If  neither  option  is
              specified,  -setup  is  assumed.   This option cannot be used in
              summary reports.

DESCRIPTION
       This command generates a report of clock  timing  information  for  the
       current design.

       Several reporting options allow you to examine skew, latency, and tran-
       sition time attributes of a specified clock network  or  subnetwork  at
       various levels of generality.  By default, the report displays the val-
       ues of these attributes only at sink pins (that is, the clock  pins  of
       sequential  devices)  of the clock network.  Use the -verbose option to
       display source-to-sink path  traces.   If  you  specify  several  clock
       domains,  report_clock_timing  generates  a separate subreport for each
       domain.

       At the highest level of abstraction is the summary style report,  which
       provides  only  a  list  of maxima and minima of the skew, latency, and
       transition time attributes over the given networks.  At a  lower  level
       of  abstraction  are  the  transition,  latency, and skew type reports,
       called list style reports, in which you can sort, filter,  and  display
       the  worst set of sink pins in the given network with respect to a sin-
       gle attribute of interest.  For skew reports, each report  entry  is  a
       pair  of  sink  pins  and  their relative skew.  For transition time or
       latency reports, each entry corresponds to a single sink pin.  The low-
       est  level  of  abstraction  is  provided  by  the  verbose mode, which
       replaces every sink pin in a list style  report  with  a  corresponding
       source-to-sink path trace.

       In  both  summary  and  list  style  reports,  the  right  column is an
       attribute column.  Corresponding to each sink pin, the  character  sym-
       bols in this column indicate the following:

                 Symbol    Meaning
                 ------    -------
                 w         Worst-case operating condition
                 b         Best-case operating condition
                 r         Rising transition
                 f         Falling transition
                 p         Propagated clock to this pin
                 i         Clock inversion to this pin
                 e         Exception on this pin
                 -         Launching transition
                 +         Capturing transition

       In  verbose  mode, back-annotations on path elements in the timing path
       are indicated by a character symbol.  For definitions of these  charac-
       ter symbols, see the man page for the report_timing command.

       Skews reported by report_clock_timing are local skews only.  Local skew
       exists from one sink pin to another only  as  long  as  the  associated
       sequential  devices  are  connected  via a data path in the appropriate
       from-to sense.  Note that even if all data paths between the sequential
       devices  are  false  because of user-defined exceptions, the skew still
       qualifies as local skew if the devices are connected topologically.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       By default, this command uses information from  the  current  scenario.
       You can select different scenarios by using the -scenarios option.
