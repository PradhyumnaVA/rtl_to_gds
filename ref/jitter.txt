NAME
       set_clock_jitter
              Sets the duty-cycle jitter and/or the cycle clock jitter.

SYNTAX
       status set_clock_jitter
               [-cycle cycle_to_cycle_jitter]
               [-duty_cycle duty_cycle_jitter]
               -clocks clock_list

   Data Types
       cycle_to_cycle_jitter     float
       duty_cycle_jitter         float
       clock_list                list

ARGUMENTS
       -cycle cycle_to_cycle_jitter
              Specifies the cycle-to-cycle jitter on the clock.

       -duty_cycle duty_cycle_jitter
              Specifies the duty-cycle jitter on the clock.

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  specifies  the  cycle-to-cycle jitter and the duty-cycle
       jitter on a primary master clock(a clock that is not a generated  clock
       itself),  or  a  generated  clock that is defined with the -multiply_by
       option.

       Cycle-to-cycle jitter models the variation between the edges  that  are
       in-phase.  In  other  words,  it models the variation between the edges
       that are multiple clock cycles apart.

       Duty-cycle jitter models the variation between the edges that are  out-
       of-phase.   In  other  words, they are 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and so on, cycles
       apart.

       Duty-cycle jitter and cycle-to-cycle jitter are  realized  between  the
       launch  clock  and  the  capture clock that are both generated from the
       same master clock.  To figure out the right clock jitter value  between
       the  launch  clock  and capture clock, we trace the launch edge and the
       capture edge to corresponding edges of  the  master  clock.  There  are
       three cases to consider:

       1.  If  the corresponding edges of the master clock are multiple cycles
         apart.
            cycle-to-cycle jitter is realized.
       2. If they are not and integral number of cycles apart.
            duty-cycle jitter is realized.
       3. If they are traced back to the same edge of the master clock.
            no clock jitter is realized.

       In crosstalk analysis, clock jitter does not change the arrival windows
       used  in  overlap  analysis. However, in level-sensitive latch designs,
       latches can start borrowing in the presence of clock jitter, leading to
       changes  in  delta  delays  for  logic  nets  in the fanout of affected
       latches.

       Please note that the generated clocks  defined  with  the  -multiply_by
       option do not inherit the clock jitter from their master clocks.

       To  remove  the  clock jitters set by the set_clock_jitter command, use
       the remove_clock_jitter command.

       To view clock jitter information, use the report_clock_jitter command.

EXAMPLES
       The following example specifies a  cycle-to-cycle  jitter  of  0.5  and
       duty-cycle jitter of 0.7 on the clock mclk

         prompt> set_clock_jitter -clock [get_clocks mclk] -cycle 0.5 -duty_cycle 0.7
