                             set_clock_transition

NAME
       set_clock_transition
              Sets  the  transition  time  at the clock pins of all sequential
              devices clocked by the specified ideal clocks.

SYNTAX
       status set_clock_transition
               transition
               [-rise | -fall]
               [-min]
               [-max]
               clock_list

   Data Types
       transition     float
       clock_list     collection

ARGUMENTS
       transition
              Specifies the transition time at the clock pins of  the  sequen-
              tial  devices  clocked  by  the  specified ideal clocks, in time
              units of the technology library used during optimization.

       -rise | -fall
              Specifies whether the value applies to rising or falling transi-
              tions at the clock pins of the sequential devices. If neither is
              specified, both rising and falling clock  transitions  are  set.
              If  you  specify  only  -rise or only -fall and do not specify a
              transition time for the other type of  transition,  the  default
              value, 0.0, applies to the other type of transition.

       -min   Specifies that the value applies to minimum delay analysis only.
              By default, the transition value applies  to  both  minimum  and
              maximum delay analysis.

       -max   Specifies that the value applies to maximum delay analysis only.
              By default, the transition value applies  to  both  minimum  and
              maximum delay analysis.

       clock_list
              Specifies  the  ideal  clocks  to  which  the  transition  value
              applies.  The specified transition time applies to all  register
              clock pins in the transitive fanout of each specified clock.

DESCRIPTION
       This  command explicitly specifies the transition time of clock signals
       that reach the clock pins  of  sequential  devices  in  the  transitive
       fanout of one or more ideal clocks.

       This  command  is especially useful before layout, when clock trees are
       incomplete and the clocks have ideal behavior. By default, ideal clocks
       have  a  transition  time of zero. To get more accurate timing results,
       specify an estimated nonzero transition time.

       If you specify the name of a  propagated  clock  instead  of  an  ideal
       clock,  the transition time value is ignored; the calculated transition
       time is used instead. You should set clocks  to  be  propagated  clocks
       only after the final clock trees are constructed.

       The   command  sets  one  or  more  of  the  clock_transition_fall_max,
       clock_transition_fall_min, clock_transition_rise_max, and clock_transi-
       tion_rise_min attributes of the specified clock objects.

       To  undo  the  effects  of  the  set_clock_transition  command, use the
       remove_clock_transition, remove_attribute, or reset_design command.

       To list all clock  transition  values  that  have  been  set,  use  the
       report_clock -skew command.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command applies to the current scenario only.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command sets both the rise and fall transition times to
       0.75 on the clock pins of all sequential elements clocked by the  clock
       named CLK1:

         prompt> set_clock_transition 0.75 CLK1

       The  following  command sets the fall transition time to 0.64 for maxi-
       mum-delay analysis on the clock pins of all sequential elements clocked
       by CLK1 and CLK2:

         prompt> set_clock_transition 0.64 -fall -max {CLK1 CLK2}

       The  following  command sets both the rise and fall transition times to
       0.20 on the clock pins  of  all  sequential  elements  clock  by  ideal
       clocks:

         prompt> set_clock_transition 0.20 [all_clocks]
