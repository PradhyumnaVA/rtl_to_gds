                             set_input_transition

NAME
       set_input_transition
              Sets  the  max_transition_rise, max_transition_fall, min_transi-
              tion_rise, or min_transition_fall attributes  to  the  specified
              transition values on the specified input and inout ports.

SYNTAX
       status set_input_transition
               transition
               [-rise] [-fall] [-min] [-max]
               port_list

   Data Types
       transition     float
       port_list      collection

ARGUMENTS
       transition
              Specifies  a nonnegative transition value to which the max_tran-
              sition_rise,   max_transition_fall,    min_transition_rise    or
              min_transition_fall  attributes  are  to  be set on the ports in
              port_list. The transition is the transition time of a slope that
              drives  the  port,  such  that  a  higher transition value means
              longer delays. Thus, a transition of 0 is  infinite  transition,
              or no delay between the ports and all that is connected to them.
              transition must be  in  units  consistent  with  the  technology
              library used during optimization.

       -rise  -fall
              Indicates  that  the rise or fall attributes of port_list are to
              be set to transition. If neither is specified, both are  set  to
              transition.

       -min -max
              Indicates that the transition value is to be applied for minimum
              or maximum delay analysis. If no value is specified for  minimum
              analysis, the maximum value is used.

       port_list
              Specifies a list of names of input or inout ports in the current
              design, on which the transition value is to be set. If you spec-
              ify  more  than  one  port, you must enclose the ports in either
              quotes or braces ({}).

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the max_transition_rise, max_transition_fall,  min_transition_rise
       or  min_transition_fall attributes to transition on specified input and
       inout ports in the current design.

       Note: The set_input_transition command removes any  corresponding  rise
       or  fall  driving  cell attributes and rise or fall drive attributes on
       the specified  ports.  If  you  want  a  fixed  transition  value,  use
       set_input_transition,   otherwise,   use  set_driving_cell  instead  of
       set_drive, if possible.

       To view transition information on ports, use report_port -verbose.   To
       remove  transition  attributes  from  ports,  use remove_attribute. The
       reset_design command removes all attributes from  a  design,  including
       the transition attributes.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command applies to the current scenario only.

EXAMPLES
       The  following example sets the maximum rise and fall transition values
       of ports A, B, and C to 7.0.

         prompt> set_input_transition 7.0 {A B C}

       The following example sets the maximum rise and fall transition  values
       of  all  input ports to 7 and sets the maximum rise transition value on
       port B to 11.

         prompt> set_input_transition 7 [all_inputs]
         prompt> set_input_transition -rise 11 B

       The following example sets the minimum fall transition value on port  C
       to 13.

         prompt> set_input_transition -fall -min 13.0 {C}
