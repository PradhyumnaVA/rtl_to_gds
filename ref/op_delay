       port_pin_list     list

ARGUMENTS
       delay_value
              Specifies the path delay.  The delay_value must be in units con-
              sistent  with  the  technology library used during optimization.
              The delay_value represents the amount of time that the signal is
              required  before  a  clock edge.  For maximum output delay, this
              usually represents a combinational path delay to a register plus
              the  library  setup  time  of that register.  For minimum output
              delay, this value is usually the shortest path delay to a regis-
              ter minus the library hold time.

       -reference_pin pin_port_name
              Specifies  the clock pin or port to which the specified delay is
              related.  If you use this option, and if propagated clocking  is
              being  used,  the  delay value is related to the arrival time at
              the specified reference pin, which is clock source latency  plus
              its network latency from the clock source to this reference pin.
              The        options         -network_latency_included         and
              -source_latency_included  cannot be used at the same time as the
              -reference_pin option. For  ideal  clock  network,  only  source
              latency is applied.

              The  pin  specified  with  the -reference_pin option should be a
              leaf pin or port in a clock network, in the direct or transitive
              fanout  of  a  clock source specified with the -clock option. If
              multiple clocks reach the port or pin where you are setting  the
              input  delay,  and if the -clock option is not used, the command
              considers all of the clocks.

       -clock clock_name
              Specifies the clock to which the specified delay is related.  If
              -clock_fall  is  used,  -clock clock_name must be specified.  If
              -clock is not specified, the delay is relative to time zero  for
              combinational  designs.   For  sequential  designs, the delay is
              considered relative to a new clock  with  period  determined  by
              considering  the  sequential  cells  in the transitive fanout of
              each port.

              The clock can be either a string or collection of one object.

       -clock_fall
              Specifies that the delay is relative to the falling edge of  the
              clock.  If -clock is specified, the default is the rising edge.

       -level_sensitive
              Specifies that the destination of the delay is a level-sensitive
              latch.  This allows the tool to derive setup and hold  relation-
              ship  for  paths  to  this  port as if it were a level-sensitive
              latch.  If -level_sensitive is not used,  the  output  delay  is
              treated as if it were a path to a flip-flop.

       -network_latency_included
              Specifies  that the clock network latency should not be added to
              the output delay value.  If this option is  not  specified,  the
              clock  network latency of the related clock is added to the out-
              put delay value.  It has no effect if the clock is propagated or
              the output delay is not specified with respect to any clock.

       -source_latency_included
              Specifies  that  the clock source latency should not be added to
              the output delay value.  If this option is  not  specified,  the
              clock source latency of the related clock is added to the output
              delay value.  It has no effect if the output delay is not speci-
              fied with respect to any clock.

       -rise  Specifies  that  delay_value  refers  to  a rising transition on
              specified ports of the current design.   If  neither  -rise  nor
              -fall  is  specified, then rising and falling delays are assumed
              to be equal.

       -fall  Specifies that delay_value refers to  a  falling  transition  on
              specified  ports  of  the  current design.  If neither -rise nor
              -fall is specified, then rising and falling delays  are  assumed
              to be equal.

       -max   Specifies  that delay_value refers to the longest path.  If nei-
              ther -max nor -min is  specified,  maximum  and  minimum  output
              delays are assumed to be equal.

       -min   Specifies that delay_value refers to the shortest path.  If nei-
              ther -max nor -min is  specified,  maximum  and  minimum  output
              delays are assumed to be equal.

       -add_delay
              Specifies  whether to add delay information to the existing out-
              put delay, or to overwrite. The -add_delay option enables you to
              capture  information about multiple paths leading from an output
              port that are relative to different clocks or clock edges.

              For example, the following command  removes  all  other  maximum
              rise  output delay from OUT1, since -add_delay is not specified.
              Other output delay with a different clock or with clock_fall  is
              removed.

                prompt> set_output_delay 5.0 -max -rise -clock phi1 {OUT1}

              In the following example, -add_delay is specified:

                prompt> set_output_delay 5.0 -max -rise -clock phi1 \
                        -add_delay {Z}

              If  there  is an output maximum rise delay for Z relative to the
              clock phi1 rising edge, the larger value is used.   The  smaller
              value does not result in critical timing for maximum delay.  For
              minimum delay, the smaller value is used.  If there  is  maximum
              rise  output  delay  relative  to a different clock or different
              edge of the same clock, it remains with the new delay.

       -group_path group_name
              Specifies that paths ending at the specified ports or  pins  are
              added  into  the  named  group.   If  the group does not already
              exist, it is created.  This is equivalent to specifying the fol-
              lowing command in addition to set_output_delay:

                prompt> group_path -name group_name -to port_pin_list

              If  -group_path  is not specified, the existing path grouping is
              not changed.

       port_pin_list
              A list of output port or  internal  pin  names  in  the  current
              design  to  which  delay_value  is  assigned.   If more than one
              object is specified, the objects are enclosed in  double  quota-
              tion marks ("") or in braces ({}).  If output delay is specified
              on a pin, the cell of the pin is set to size only to leave  room
              for compile applying sizing on it.

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  sets  output  path  delay values for the current design.
       Used with the set_load and set_driving_cell  commands,  the  input  and
       output  delays  characterize  the  operating environment of the current
       design.

       The set_output_delay command sets output path delays  on  output  ports
       relative  to  a clock edge.  Output ports are assumed to have no output
       delay unless specified.  For inout (bidirectional) ports, you can spec-
       ify the path delays for both input and output modes.

       To   describe  a  path  delay  to  a  level-sensitive  latch,  use  the
       -level_sensitive option.  If the latch  is  positive-enabled,  set  the
       output  delay relative to the rising clock edge.  If the latch is nega-
       tive-enabled, set the output delay relative to the falling clock  edge.
       If  time  is  being borrowed at that latch, subtract that time borrowed
       from the path delay to the latch when determining output delay.

       The characterize command automatically sets  input  and  output  delay,
       drive, and load values based on the environment of a cell instance.

       The  tool  adds input delay to path delay for paths starting at primary
       inputs and output delay for paths ending at primary outputs.

       The -group_path option  modifies  the  path  grouping.   Path  grouping
       affects  the  maximum  delay  cost function.  The worst violator within
       each group adds to the cost.  For  optimization,  grouping  some  paths
       separately  may  improve  their  delay  cost,  but it may also increase
       design area and compile time.

       Use report_port to list output delays associated with ports.   To  list
       output    delays    of   internal   pins,   use   report_design.    Use
       report_path_group to list the path groups which are defined.

       Use remove_output_delay or reset_design to remove output delay  values.
       To modify paths grouped with the -group_path option, use the group_path
       command to place the paths in another group or the default group.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command applies to the current scenario only.

EXAMPLES
       The following example sets an output delay of 1.7 relative to the  ris-
       ing edge of CLK1 for all output ports in the design.

         prompt> set_output_delay 1.7 -clock [get_clocks CLK1] \
            [all_outputs]

       The  following  example sets the input and output delays for the INOUT1
       bidirectional port.  The input signal arrives at INOUT1 2.5 units after
       the  falling  edge of CLK1.  The output signal is required at INOUT1 at
       1.4 units before the rising edge of CLK2.

         prompt> set_input_delay 2.5 -clock CLK1 -clock_fall {INOUT1}
         prompt> set_output_delay 1.4 -clock CLK2 {INOUT1}

       In the following example, there are three paths from  the  OUT1  output
       port.   One  path is relative to the rising edge of CLK1.  Another path
       is relative to the falling edge of CLK1.  The third path is relative to
       the  falling  edge  of CLK2.  The -add_delay option is used to indicate
       that new output delay information will not cause old information to  be
       removed.

         prompt> set_output_delay 2.2 -max -clock CLK1 \
            -add_delay {OUT1}
         prompt> set_output_delay 1.7 -max -clock CLK1 \
            -clock_fall -add_delay {OUT1}
         prompt> set_output_delay 4.3 -max -clock CLK2 \
            -clock_fall -add_delay {OUT1}

       The  following  example  specifies  two  maximum delays and two minimum
       delays for the Z port using the -add_delay option.  Since the  informa-
       tion  is relative to the same clock and clock edge, only the largest of
       the maximum values (5.0) and the smallest of the minimum  values  (1.1)
       are maintained.  If the -add_delay option is not used, the new informa-
       tion overwrites the old information.

         prompt> set_output_delay 3.4 -max -clock CLK1 \
            -add_delay {Z}
         prompt> set_output_delay 5.0 -max -clock CLK1 \
            -add_delay {Z}
         prompt> set_output_delay 1.1 -min -clock CLK1 \
            -add_delay {Z}
         prompt> set_output_delay 1.3 -min -clock CLK1 \
            -add_delay {Z}

       The following example uses the -group_path option to add ports  into  a
       named group.  Without this option, paths to these ports are included in
       the CLK group.

     prompt> set_output_delay 4.5 -max -clock CLK \
        -group_path busA {busA[*]}
